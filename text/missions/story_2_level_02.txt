MISSION 17:
school laboratory

DESCRIPTION:
they used to study here - all 
these pupils and students, 
with their lessons, exams, 
textbooks, and crib sheets, 
of course. but now it's so quiet 
in the classrooms... a kind 
of unnatural silence, from time 
to time interrupted by 
groans and growls.

OBJECTIVE:
examine the rooms of the school 
building, try to find survivors, 
destroy every alien you meet.
