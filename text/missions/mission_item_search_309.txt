BASE SUPPLIES


shortly after the invasion, 
pretty much all manufacturing on the 
planet was suspended. 
to survive, you have to regularly 
raid the infected area to top up your 
food, weapon, and 
medication supplies.

your activity in the area keeps 
attracting new crowds of aliens. 
take only what you need and only 
as much as you need 
and quickly return to the car.
