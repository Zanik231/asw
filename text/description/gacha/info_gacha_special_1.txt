Temporary event! Variable code is alredy avaliable! During the period of validity of this variable code, 
the probability of droping exclusive legendary first class equipment will increase strongly: MAGNUM SW00. 
Exclusive equipment from this variable code will not be available in the standard code.

Reguilary basic probability of receiving of all equipment is distributed evenly.
Read special rules if any conditions or guarantees apply.

Rules.
As long as this variable code is available, the basic probability of dropping legendary first class 
equipment = 0,600%. Total probability (including the guaranteed prize)=1,600%. Dropping the legendary first class 
equipment at least once in 90 attempt is guaranteed.
The first item of legendary first class equipment with a 50,000% probability will be an exclusive MAGNUM SW00 
large-caliber pistol. If another legendary fisrt class equipment item is received first, the next one is guaranteed 
to be the specified exclusive item.
Basic probability of dropping legendary started class equipment = 5,100%. Total probability
(including the guaranteed prize)=13,000%. Dropping legendary start and higher class equipment at least
in 10 attempt is guaranteed. In this case probability to drop legendary start class equipment= 99,400% 
and probability to drop legendary first class equipment=0,600%.

Duplicates.
If you have recurring legendary equipment of the first class, then from 2 to 7 they are converted into 
increased equipment level. For 8 and more repetitive equipment of the first class
you can get x25 Plutonium isotopes.
If you have recurring legendary equipment of the start class, then from 2 to 7 they are converted into 
increased equipment level. For 8 and more repetitive equipment of the initial class 
you can get x5 Plutonium isotopes.

It's a variable code. The number of guaranteed attempts for it is calculated separately and does not 
affect the number of guaranteed attempts of other codes.
