Recruit code is the standart code. It hasn't time limits.
In recruit code there are avaliable not excluzive legendary equipment.
10 recruit codes cost 20% less uranium power units. Also with first 10 codes you are surely get legendary 
started class sub machine gun COPAX NP, and the legendary first or started class equipment with next 10 codes!
The recruit code ends after 20 attempts. The code page will become unavailable when recruit codes will be ended.

Reguilary basic probability of receiving of all equipment is distributed evenly.
Read special rules if any conditions or guarantees apply.

Rules.
Basic probability of dropping legendary first class equipment = 0,600%.
Basic probability of dropping legendary starter class equipment = 5,100%, the total probability 
(including the guaranteed prize) = 13,000%. Guaranteed drop of legendary start and higher class 
equipment at least once in 10 attempts.

Duplicates.
If you have recurring legendary equipment of the first class, then from 2 to 7 they are converted into 
increased equipment level. For 8 and more repetitive equipment of the first class
you can get x25 Plutonium isotopes.
If you have recurring legendary equipment of the start class, then from 2 to 7 they are converted into 
increased equipment level. For 8 and more repetitive equipment of the initial class 
you can get x5 Plutonium isotopes.

This is the rookie code. The number of guaranteed attempts for it is calculated separately 
and does not affect the number of guaranteed attempts of other codes.
