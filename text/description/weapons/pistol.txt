Side-arms

The best weapon for particularly difficult missions. It is characterized 
by the maximum effective firing range, among all weapons on kinetic 
ammunition and huge damage to single targets. A fighter armed with 
a pistol moves very quickly on the battlefield, but slows down as much 
as possible during shooting.
