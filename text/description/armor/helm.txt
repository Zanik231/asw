Soldiers don't start with a helmet, 
but without a helmet it ends quickly. 
The power of the helmet affects 
the overall power of the fighter, 
and additional equipment features 
allow you to improve many different 
characteristics. Depending on the 
rarity of the helmet, it may have 
1-4 additional features.
