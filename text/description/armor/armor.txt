As they say, a good soldier is 
a living soldier, and in order 
to survive, you need to take care 
of the armor. The power of the armor 
affects the overall power of the fighter, 
and additional equipment features allow you 
to improve many different characteristics. 
Depending on the rarity of the armor, 
it may have 1-4 additional features.
