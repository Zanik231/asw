From the laboratory register:
date: October 30 2027.

There is not much time left - the monsters 
occupy larger territories. Today we have 
grown the first prototype of the virus. 
The prototype Is fully functional, but 
cannot self-reproduce for the time being. 
It seems that weï¿½ve got real close.
